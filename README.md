# Analysis of Aviation Accidents and Wildlife Strikes

Aviation safety is a critical field where even small insights can save lives.  
This project combines two major datasets — **NTSB aviation accident reports** and **FAA wildlife strike records** — to deliver a comprehensive analysis of the risks and contributing factors in air transport.  

Through advanced data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, we uncover trends over time, identify geographic hotspots, and highlight key variables such as pilot experience, aircraft type, and flight phases.  

By integrating accident data with wildlife strike incidents via common features and tables, the project aims to provide deeper insights into aviation safety, ultimately supporting risk assessment and data-driven safety improvements.

## Overview
This project is part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** under the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT).  
It focuses on analyzing aviation accidents using data from the NTSB and studying wildlife strikes using data from the FAA.  
The datasets are connected through common features and tables to provide integrated insights.
