# Analysis of Aviation Accidents and Wildlife Strikes

Aviation safety is a critical field where even small insights can save lives.  
This project combines two major datasets — **NTSB aviation accident reports** and **FAA wildlife strike records** — to deliver a comprehensive analysis of the risks and contributing factors in air transport.  

Through advanced **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **visualization techniques**, we uncover trends over time, identify geographic hotspots, and highlight key variables such as **pilot experience**, **aircraft type**, and **flight phases**.  

By integrating accident data with wildlife strike incidents via **common features and tables**, the project aims to provide deeper insights into aviation safety, ultimately supporting **risk assessment** and **data-driven safety improvements**.

## Overview
This project is part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** under the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT).  
It focuses on analyzing **aviation accidents** using data from the **NTSB** and studying **wildlife strikes** using data from the **FAA**.  
The datasets will be connected through **common features and tables** to provide integrated insights.
