# Analysis-of-Aviation-Accidents-and-Wildlife-Strikes
This project analyzes aviation safety through accidents, incidents, and wildlife strikes. It explores trends over time, geographic hotspots, and key factors such as pilot experience and flight phases. Using data cleaning, EDA, and visualization, it uncovers patterns to provide insights into risks and safety improvements.

## Overview
This project is part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** under the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT).  
It focuses on analyzing **aviation accidents** using data from the **NTSB** and studying **wildlife strikes** using data from the **FAA**.  
The datasets will be connected through **common features and tables** to provide integrated insights.
